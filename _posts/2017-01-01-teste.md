            <div>
                <p>Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many
                advantages over analog image processing.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 1</h2>

                <p>The developed program receive three inputs, the image that you want and the two points with coordinates inside the image. A negative is an image that the lightest part appear darkest and the darkest  appear lightest. This occurs because we take the pixel RGB color and subtract 255. The program will do the value changes at each image pixel (the pixel needs be inside of the resulting region from x and y).  </p>

                </div>
                <p>The first concept we must work on is ROI (Region of Interest). The region of interest, as the name itself tells us, specifies a subregion of a larger region to which we will assign our operations. When working with images, our ROI is a part of the image, and in it we will perform some specific operations without having to perform it in the complete image.
                In this program, we take chunks of images and swap then using a axiliary matrix, its a intuitive code.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/danmouracunha/28560a8305943c9f8273efd7cf05b75e.js"></script>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 3</h2>
                <p>We use this program to search and count the all objects, we scanned all image trying find a pixel with a value of 255. When the pixel is found we use the <code>flood fill()</code> command to fill every space to which the pixel belongs, so this space must have the same pixel gray</p>
                <p>To solve this we can use a variable <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> that can represent 56636 and  4294967296 objects respectively. Even if the human eye can not observe all these variations of tone, the representation will be important at the program level for the labeling of items</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 4</h2>
                <div class="">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://goo.gl/bG0bBi" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>In this exercice we have to label the elements, to To distinguish what is a bubble and what is a circle.</p>
                <p>To do that we paint the perimeter in the color of the objects and use the <code>floodfill</code> funtion to eliminate the objects that are not appearing completely.</p>
                <p>In the next step we painted the background of another color (to help in the other step that i will explain later). Proceeding, we must use the code provided to identify the number of elements in the figure.</p>
                <p>Now, you should do it again, but in a different way :D </p>
                <p> We go through the image looking for black, remember we painted the bottom of the image of another shade of gray and where it has black will be identified like a bubble; We will make a <code>floodfill</code> in the black spaces painting of the color of the identification of an image and paint again of another color so that the bubbles differ from the circles.</p>
                <p>So, now we have all we need: the number of figures, bubles and circles.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 5</h2>
                <p>This exercise has the objective equalize images from camera in real time and show the histogram. Equalization is a method to let the images better, making the viewing of very dark or very light images become better, doing the colors that are very concentrated in a region of the histrogram to be distributed throughout the entire range of the histogram</p>

                <p>The Gaussian filter smoothes the edges of the images, making the image less clear. In contrast, this filter can attenuate the effect of noise on the image</p>

                <p>The principle of Tilt Shift is based on giving a small angle to the camera lens; Instead of the lens being parallel to the camera's focus plane, there is a slight tilt between the two axes. This causes the focus of the camera to be only in one of the regions of the image, leaving other parts with distortion or blurring.</p>
