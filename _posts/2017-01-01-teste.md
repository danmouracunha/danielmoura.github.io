            <h1>Digital image processing</h1>

            <p>Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many
             advantages over analog image processing.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 1</h2>

            <p>A negative is an image that the lightest part appear darkest and the lightest appear darkest. This occurs because we take the pixel RGB color and subtract 255. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 2</h2>

            <p>In this program, we take chunks of images and swap then using a axiliary matrix, its a intuitive code.</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/danmouracunha/28560a8305943c9f8273efd7cf05b75e.js"></script>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 3</h2>

            <p>In <code>labeling.cpp</code> has more than 255 in the scene, the process will be compromissed because he uses a variable <code>uchar</code> that can represent only 8 bits, so the max representation will be 255 objects.</p>

            <p>To solve this we can use a variable <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> that can represent 56636 and  4294967296 objects respectively. 
            Even if the human eye can not observe all these variations of tone, the representation will be important at the program level for the labeling of items</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Exercice 4</h2>
            <p>In this exercice we have to label the elements, to To distinguish what is a bubble and what is a circle.</p>
            
            <p>To do that we paint the perimeter in the color of the objects and use the <code>floodfill</code> funtion to eliminate the objects that are not appearing completely.</p>

            <p>In the next step we painted the background of another color (to help in the other step that i will explain later). Proceeding, we must use the code provided to identify the number of elements in the figure.</p>

            <p>Now, you should do it again, but in a different way :D </p>
            <p> We go through the image looking for black, remember we painted the bottom of the image of another shade of gray and where it has black will be identified like a bubble; We will make a <code>floodfill</code> in the black spaces painting of the color of the identification of an image and paint again of another color so that the bubbles differ from the circles.</p>
            <p>So, now we have all we need: the number of figures, bubles and circles.</p>
